# Hands on Machine Learning sample project

This sample project is taken from the awesome book ["Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition (2019)"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).

## Installation

- Install a local **python** and **jupyter** environment:
  - I recommend VS Code with the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extensions installed.
  - To install multiple Python versions use `pyenv` ([here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Linux/macOS or [here](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for Windows) and install Python 3.8.x and make it local.
  - Create the local python environment running `python3 -m venv FOLDER_NAME_HERE`
  - VS Code will prompt you to use the just created environment, but in any case ensure you choose it.
- Install dependencies running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
